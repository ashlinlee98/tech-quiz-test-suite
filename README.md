  ## Description
  This application is a Tech Quiz built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) that allows users to take a quiz consisting of 10 random tech-related questions. The quiz tracks user progress, provides feedback, and calculates the final score after all questions are answered. The application is enhanced with Cypress for both component and end-to-end testing to ensure reliability and robustness. The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate comprehensive testing in modern web applications.

  ## Tests
  Cypress is used to ensure the reliability of the quiz component. The following types of tests have been created:

- Component Tests: Verifying that individual components, such as the quiz start button and question display, function as expected.
- End-to-End Tests: Ensuring the full flow of the quiz, from starting the quiz to viewing the final score, works correctly.

You can run the tests by opening Cypress: "npm run test".
